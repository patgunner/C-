A recommender system aims to provide users with personalized online product or service recommendations to
handle the increasing online information overload problem and improve customer relationship management.
Various recommender system techniques have been proposed since the mid-1990s, and many sorts of recom-
mender system software have been developed recently for a variety of applications. Researchers and managers
recognize that recommender systems offer great opportunities and challenges for business, government, educa-
tion, and other domains, with more recent successful developments of recommender systems for real-world ap-
plications becoming apparent. It is thus vital that a high quality, instructive review of current trends should be
conducted, not only of the theoretical research results but more importantly of the practical developments in
recommender systems. This paper therefore reviews up-to-date application developments of recommender sys-
tems, clusters their applications into eight main categories: e-government, e-business, e-commerce/e-shopping,
e-library, e-learning, e-tourism, e-resource services and e-group activities, and summarizes the related recom-
mendation techniques used in each category. It systematically examines the reported recommender systems
through four dimensions: recommendation methods (such as CF), recommender systems software (such as
BizSeeker), real-world application domains (such as e-business) and application platforms (such as mobile-
based platforms). Some significant new topics are identified and listed as new directions. By providing a state-
of-the-art knowledge, this survey will directly support researchers and practical professionals in their under-
standing of developments in recommender system applications. Recommender systems can be defined as programs which attempt
to recommend the most suitable items (products or services) to partic-
ular users (individuals or businesses) by predicting a user's interest in an
item based on related information about the items, the users and the in-
teractions between items and users [1]. The aim of developing recom-
mender systems is to reduce information overload by retrieving the
most relevant information and services from a huge amount of data,
thereby providing personalized services. The most important feature
of a recommender system is its ability to “guess” a user's preferences
and interests by analyzing the behavior of this user and/or the behavior
of other users to generate personalized recommendations [2].
E-service personalization techniques are typified by recommender
systems, which have gained much attention in the past 20 years [3].
Early research in recommender systems grew out of information re-
trieval and filtering research [4], and recommender systems emerged as an independent research area in the mid-1990s when researchers
started to focus on recommendation problems that explicitly rely on
the rating structure [3]. Commonly used recommendation tech-
niques include collaborative filtering (CF) [5], content-based (CB)
[6] and knowledge-based (KB) [7] techniques. Each recommenda-
tion approach has advantages and limitations; for example, CF has
sparseness, scalability and cold-start problems [3,5], while CB has
overspecialized recommendations [3]. To solve these problems,
many advanced recommendation approaches have been proposed,
such as social network-based recommender systems [8], fuzzy recom-
mender systems [9,10], context awareness-based recommender sys-
tems [11] and group recommender systems [12].
With the development of recommendation approaches and tech-
niques, more and more recommender systems (software) have been
implemented and many real-world recommender system applications
have been developed. It was pointed out recently that application
study is the main research focus of current recommender system
research, especially in the current age of big data [1,13]. The applications
of recommender systems include recommending movies, music, televi-
sion programs, books, documents, websites, conferences, tourism scenic
spots and learning materials, and involve the areas of e-commerce,
e-learning, e-library, e-government and e-business services. Therefore,
